      "content": "Short answer:  \nIf EVA is already “private, secure, accessible,” NIST doesn’t magically make it *more* secret — it gives you a **common, externally-recognizable playbook** for how you govern risk, build and operate the platform, and prove it to auditors, partners, and Treasury Board–type folks.\n\nThink: *less “trust us, it’s secure” and more “here’s exactly how we meet AI/cyber/privacy good practice X, Y, Z.”*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)\n\n**What it is**  \nNIST’s AI RMF is a voluntary framework for managing AI-specific risk, built around four functions: **Govern, Map, Measure, Manage**.\n\n**What it adds to EVA**\n\nOn top of “EVA is safe and private,” AI RMF would push you to:\n\n- **Govern** – Make EVA’s AI risk governance explicit: who owns which risks (Ops, AI COE, business owners), how decisions are escalated, how often risks are reviewed, etc.\n- **Map** – Systematically map EVA use cases (EVA Chat, DA, Jurisprudence, AssistMe, KM) to *impacted people, contexts, and harms* (bias, denial of benefits, incorrect decisions).\n- **Measure** – Define **metrics**: hallucination rates, retrieval quality, response time, abuse detection, access violations, etc., and how you test them.\n- **Manage** – Formalize **risk treatment**: e.g., when a risk is identified (high hallucination rate for CPP-D), what corrective actions you take, who approves mitigations, how rollbacks work.\n\nSo EVA would go from “we’re careful” to “we have a structured, repeatable AI-risk lifecycle”—something you can show PMD, privacy, and the AI Review Panel.\n\n---\n\n## 2. NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (CSF)\n\n**What it is**  \nNIST CSF 2.0 is a high-level cyber risk framework (now with a central **Govern** function) plus the classic **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover** functions.\n\n**What it adds to EVA**\n\nFor EVA’s infra + Ops/Support (Jonathan’s world), CSF lets you:\n\n- **Translate EVA cyber posture into a standard language** used by auditors and security teams (even though you’re GoC and not US).\n- **Systematically check coverage**:\n  - *Identify*: Asset inventory for EVA (environments, APIM APIs, indexes, storage, logs).\n  - *Protect*: Access control, least privilege, secrets management, network segmentation, training.\n  - *Detect*: SIEM rules on EVA logs, anomaly detection (sudden API spikes, exfil patterns).\n  - *Respond*: Documented runbooks for incidents in EVA (leak suspicions, compromised keys, prompt-injection exploitation).\n  - *Recover*: Backup/restore of indexes, config, and project registry; how you restore service and learn from incidents.\n- **Show maturity over time** – you can literally say “EVA is at CSF Tier X in these areas; our target for next year is Tier Y.”\n\nSo, CSF puts structure around what Ops and Security are already doing, and shows where you still have blind spots.\n\n---\n\n## 3. NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF, SP 800-218)\n\n**What it is**  \nNIST’s SSDF is a set of secure-by-design practices across the software lifecycle: **Prepare, Protect, Produce, Respond** (slightly different naming depending on source, but same idea).\n\n**What it adds to EVA**\n\nFor your dev + DevOps side:\n\n- **Prepare** – Define secure coding standards for EVA (languages, framework baselines, dependency policies).\n- **Protect** – CI/CD controls: SAST/DAST, dependency scanning, signed builds, SBOMs, approvals for prod, protecting secrets.\n- **Produce** – Requirements that every new EVA feature (APIs, DA UI, LiveOps console) has:\n  - Threat modeling,\n  - Security acceptance criteria,\n  - Code reviews and test evidence.\n- **Respond** – How you handle **vulns and supply-chain issues** (e.g., model library bugs, Azure SDK vulnerabilities) and patch EVA.\n\nIf you map EVA’s pipelines to SSDF, you can demonstrate: “EVA isn’t just functionally solid; it’s built and maintained using a recognized secure SDLC.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. NIST Privacy Framework\n\n**What it is**  \nA privacy-risk framework with core functions like **Identify-P, Govern-P, Control-P, Communicate-P, Protect-P** to manage how personal information is handled.\n\n**What it adds to EVA**\n\nYou already have GoC privacy rules + PIAs. The NIST Privacy Framework would:\n\n- Help you **structure privacy risks** across all EVA apps (chat logs, RAG data, analytics) using a consistent vocabulary.\n- Make sure you cover:\n  - **Identify-P** – where personal info might appear (even in embeddings, logs, cached prompts).\n  - **Govern-P** – policies, roles, and oversight mechanisms for privacy in EVA.\n  - **Control-P** – technical + procedural controls (role-based access, retention policies, redaction tools).\n  - **Communicate-P** – how you explain EVA’s privacy posture to internal users (Terms of Use, splash screens).\n  - **Protect-P** – alignment with encryption, access control, and minimization.\n\nThis gives you a neat bridge between TBS guidance, your PIA, and concrete technical controls in EVA.\n\n---\n\n## So… what does “NIST-aligned EVA” actually buy you?\n\nIn practice, if you choose to “NIST-ify” EVA, you get:\n\n1. **A common language with auditors and partners**  \n   - “Here’s our EVA AI RMF profile, our CSF 2.0 mapping, and our SSDF alignment” is way more powerful than “we follow good practices.”\n\n2. **A structured way to prioritize work**  \n   - You can say: “AI RMF highlights fairness + transparency gaps; CSF says our Detect/Respond are weaker than Protect. So the 2026 roadmap for Ops/Support is: better telemetry, incident drills, and AI performance monitoring.”\n\n3. **Evidence of due diligence**  \n   - For DM, CIO, TBS, Privacy Commissioner, etc.: “We’re using internationally recognized frameworks (NIST AI RMF, CSF, SSDF, Privacy Framework) to run and evolve EVA” shows you’re not inventing your own governance from scratch.\n\n4. **A scaffold for your AI governance story**  \n   - Your existing EVA governance (AI Review Panel, AI Register, Terms of Use, RAIDE-style risk lenses) can be mapped onto AI RMF + CSF functions, making the whole thing feel coherent and auditable.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, next step could be:  \n- take **one EVA component** (e.g., EVA Domain Assistant) and rough-map it to **AI RMF + CSF 2.0** to see where you’re already strong and where the gaps are. That’s usually enough to get Ops/Support and AI COE talking the same language."

      "content": "I’d think about this in three buckets:\n\n1. **What NIST-ish “trust” requirements you add on top of RAG**  \n2. **How to encode traceability + explainability as concrete EVA requirements**  \n3. **How to future-proof for Protected C / Secret without committing to it now**\n\nI’ll give you requirements-style bullets you can literally drop into your PRD / architecture doc.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Trust requirements to add on top of “RAG works”\n\nThese are platform-level, not just DA-UI-level.\n\n### 1.1 Governance & risk (NIST AI RMF style)\n\nNIST AI RMF is all about *govern, map, measure, manage* for AI risk. For EVA, that turns into requirements like:\n\n- **REQ-GOV-01 – Documented AI use cases**  \n  EVA SHALL maintain a registry of all AI use cases (EVA Chat, DA projects, Jurisprudence, AssistMe, KM, etc.) including: purpose, data sources, impacted user groups, and risk level.\n\n- **REQ-GOV-02 – Risk register**  \n  EVA SHALL maintain an AI risk register (aligned with TBS + NIST AI RMF) capturing identified risks (e.g., hallucinations, bias, misuse, exfiltration) and mitigations, with owners and review cadence.\n\n- **REQ-GOV-03 – Decision logs**  \n  EVA governance decisions (e.g., enabling new model, changing safety thresholds, allowing a new data source) SHALL be logged with rationale, approver, and effective date.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Traceability & explainability requirements\n\nThis is where NIST is very explicit: lots of emphasis on documentation, transparency, provenance, and explainable AI. NIST’s four principles of explainable AI are: **Explanation, Meaningful, Explanation Accuracy, Knowledge Limits**.\n\nTranslate that into EVA:\n\n### 2.1 End-to-end traceability\n\n- **REQ-TRC-01 – Answer provenance**  \n  For each response generated by EVA, the system SHALL capture a provenance record including at minimum:\n  - User, role, project space / app  \n  - Date/time, environment  \n  - Model family + version  \n  - System prompt + key settings (temperature, top_p, safety flags, etc.)  \n  - User prompt (or a redacted version where needed)  \n  - Retrieved documents: IDs, versions, source system, and relevance scores  \n  - Post-processing steps (re-ranking, redaction, translation, etc.)\n\n- **REQ-TRC-02 – Tamper-evident logs**  \n  EVA SHALL store provenance and audit logs in a tamper-evident logging solution (e.g., write-once / append-only, or cryptographically verifiable). Any alteration MUST be detectable.\n\n- **REQ-TRC-03 – Reproducibility**  \n  EVA SHALL provide a “replay” capability that allows authorized users (Ops, privacy, audit) to re-run a past interaction using the original configuration to approximate the original output, where feasible.\n\n- **REQ-TRC-04 – Lifecycle traceability**  \n  For each deployed model or major configuration, EVA SHALL record training or fine-tuning data sources (at an abstract level), evaluation results, and approval records.\n\n### 2.2 Explainability & transparency\n\nUsing NIST’s explainability principles as the backbone:\n\n- **REQ-XAI-01 – Source-linked answers**  \n  For RAG answers, EVA SHALL expose the underlying sources (document titles, sections, links) and highlight the passages that were used to generate the answer.\n\n- **REQ-XAI-02 – “Why this answer?” explanations**  \n  EVA SHALL provide an optional “Explain this answer” function that:\n  - Summarizes which documents and sections were most influential  \n  - Describes any key assumptions or constraints used during reasoning  \n  - States limitations (e.g., “Based only on sources up to YYYY-MM-DD”)\n\n- **REQ-XAI-03 – Knowledge limits banner**  \n  EVA SHALL inform users when:\n  - No relevant documents were found  \n  - Model confidence is low  \n  - The answer is extrapolated beyond available evidence  \n  (e.g., banners like “Low confidence – please verify against primary sources.”)\n\n- **REQ-XAI-04 – Model and data transparency**  \n  EVA SHALL provide a user-facing “About this assistant” panel per project that describes:\n  - Which data sources are searched  \n  - Which models are used (at least family + general capabilities)  \n  - Known limitations and appropriate use cases.\n\n- **REQ-XAI-05 – Administrative explainability views**  \n  Admin / Ops users SHALL be able to view deeper technical context (model versions, evaluation metrics, safety filters triggered) for any interaction, subject to RBAC.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Requirements beyond “it does RAG”\n\nYou already think of EVA as a shared AI platform, not just a chatbot. Requirements that reflect that:\n\n### 3.1 Multi-service AI capabilities\n\n- **REQ-FUNC-01 – AI service catalog**  \n  EVA SHALL expose AI capabilities via APIs, at minimum:\n  - Retrieval & Q&A (/rag/retrieve, /rag/answer)  \n  - Summarization (/doc/summarize)  \n  - Comparison & alignment (/doc/compare)  \n  - Extraction & classification (/doc/extract)  \n  - Assisted drafting (/gen/draft)\n\n- **REQ-FUNC-02 – Non-RAG fallbacks**  \n  EVA SHALL support non-RAG workflows (pure LLM, tools/agents, or structured data queries) with explicit flags and separate guardrails, so behaviour is transparent and auditable.\n\n- **REQ-FUNC-03 – Content provenance & synthetic content transparency**  \n  EVA SHALL support tagging of AI-generated content with provenance metadata (who, when, which assistant) and, where possible, embed digital provenance signals, consistent with emerging guidance on synthetic content transparency.\n\n### 3.2 Monitoring, quality & safety\n\n- **REQ-MON-01 – Trustworthiness metrics**  \n  EVA SHALL track metrics such as:\n  - Retrieval quality / citation coverage  \n  - User-reported issues (wrong, biased, unsafe)  \n  - Abuse / misuse attempts  \n  and expose them in a LiveOps dashboard.\n\n- **REQ-MON-02 – Red-teaming and regression tests**  \n  EVA SHALL maintain a suite of adversarial and regression test prompts (privacy leakage, bias probes, jailbreak attempts), and run them on each major model/config change.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Future-proofing for Protected C / Secret\n\nYou’re at Protected B today. If one day someone says “we need EVA-like capabilities at Protected C or Secret,” the big changes are **segregation, controls, people, and accreditation**, not just “flip a flag.”\n\nGoC defines:  \n- **Protected B** – compromise could cause *serious injury* to an individual/organization/government  \n- **Protected C** – compromise could cause *extremely grave injury*  \n- **Secret / Top Secret** – compromise could cause *serious or exceptionally grave injury* to national interests.  \nProtected C in particular calls for “special, stringent security controls.”\n\nYou can encode that into *future-state* EVA requirements like:\n\n### 4.1 Segregation & architecture\n\n- **REQ-SEC-FUT-01 – Multi-zone architecture**  \n  EVA SHALL be architected so that its core services (RAG, logging, configuration, model endpoints) can be deployed in multiple security zones (e.g., Unclassified/Protected B, Protected C, Secret) with strict physical, network, and identity separation between zones.\n\n- **REQ-SEC-FUT-02 – No cross-domain data flow by default**  \n  The default architecture SHALL prevent data flowing from higher-classification zones (Protected C/Secret) to lower zones, unless via explicitly approved, one-way, and audited mechanisms (e.g., cross-domain guards).\n\n- **REQ-SEC-FUT-03 – Pluggable dependency tiers**  \n  EVA SHALL avoid hard dependencies on services that cannot be accredited for higher security levels (e.g., public internet services, externally managed telemetry), or SHALL provide patterns to replace them with in-zone equivalents.\n\n### 4.2 Controls & people\n\n- **REQ-SEC-FUT-04 – Control set extensibility**  \n  EVA’s security control implementation (logging, crypto, backups, access controls) SHALL be documented in a way that allows mapping to stricter control baselines (e.g., CCCS guidance for specified information in non-GC systems, or departmental profiles) and extension as classification increases.\n\n- **REQ-SEC-FUT-05 – Role and clearance alignment**  \n  EVA SHALL support mapping of application roles to Government of Canada personnel screening levels (Reliability, Secret, Top Secret) so that, in higher-classification deployments, only appropriately cleared users/admins can access the environment.\n\n### 4.3 Accreditation & documentation\n\n- **REQ-SEC-FUT-06 – Accreditation package readiness**  \n  For each environment, EVA SHALL maintain up-to-date architecture diagrams, data flows, control mappings, and risk assessments sufficient to support formal security authorization / ATO at the applicable classification.\n\n- **REQ-SEC-FUT-07 – Configuration baselines**  \n  EVA SHALL define configuration baselines per classification level (e.g., cipher suites, logging detail, retention periods, backup handling), so that uplift from Protected B to Protected C or Secret is principally:\n  - deploying into the right zone, and  \n  - applying the stricter baseline,  \n  rather than redesigning the platform from scratch.\n\nYou can clearly mark these as “**Future Capability – Not in scope for initial EVA subscription**” in the doc, but having them there signals to Jonathan’s Ops & support world (and security/privacy) that the design isn’t painted into a Protected-B-forever corner.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, next step I can do is:  \n- take one of your existing EVA doc sections (e.g., “Non-functional requirements” or “Security & Compliance”) and rewrite it with these requirements baked in, grouped under headings like **Traceability**, **Explainability**, **Monitoring**, and **Future Classification Readiness**."

Purpose\n\nThis document defines platform-level requirements for the EVA ecosystem (EVA Chat, EVA Domain Assistant, EVA LiveOps, EVA Shared Services, and associated APIs) to support:\n\n- Governance and risk management aligned with recognized frameworks (e.g., NIST AI RMF, NIST CSF, NIST SSDF, privacy guidance).\n- End-to-end traceability and explainability of AI-assisted interactions.\n- Capabilities beyond basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n- Monitoring, quality, and safety controls.\n- Future readiness for deployment in higher security classifications (e.g., Protected C, Secret), without committing to them in the current scope.\n\nThese requirements supplement functional requirements (e.g., “EVA shall answer questions over curated sources”) and standard non-functional requirements (availability, performance, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Scope\n\nThese requirements apply to:\n\n- Core EVA backend services (RAG, AI orchestration, document services, configuration and project registry, logging, safety and policy guardrails).\n- EVA user interfaces (EVA Chat, EVA Domain Assistant, LiveOps console, admin portals).\n- EVA APIs and integration points (e.g., APIM-exposed services).\n- EVA operational processes (monitoring, incident response, red-teaming, change management).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Definitions\n\n- **EVA** – ESDC’s shared AI platform and its associated applications and services.\n- **Project Space** – A logical tenant/application within EVA Domain Assistant (e.g., Jurisprudence, Canada Life, AssistMe, KM workspace).\n- **RAG** – Retrieval-Augmented Generation: using search over curated content to ground AI-generated answers.\n- **Provenance** – Information describing the origin, context, and processing steps that led to an AI-generated output.\n- **Explainability** – The degree to which an AI system’s operations can be understood and meaningfully explained to its users and administrators.\n- **Protected B/C** – Government of Canada security classifications indicating increasing levels of potential injury if information is compromised.\n- **Secret** – Security classification for information whose compromise would cause serious injury to national interests.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Governance & Risk Management Requirements\n\n**REQ-GOV-01 – AI Use Case Registry**  \nEVA SHALL maintain a centralized registry of all AI use cases and applications (e.g., EVA Chat, individual EVA DA project spaces, Jurisprudence, AssistMe, KM assistant), including at minimum:\n\n- Purpose and description  \n- Owner / business sponsor  \n- Target user groups  \n- Data sources accessed  \n- Risk level (low/medium/high) and rationale  \n\n**REQ-GOV-02 – AI Risk Register**  \nEVA SHALL maintain an AI risk register that captures identified risks (e.g., hallucinations, bias, misuse, data exfiltration, privacy violations), their impact and likelihood, mitigation measures, and assigned risk owners. The register SHALL be reviewed on a defined cadence (e.g., quarterly) and updated following major changes.\n\n**REQ-GOV-03 – Governance Decision Logging**  \nEVA SHALL log key governance decisions affecting risk (e.g., enabling new models, onboarding new data sources, changing safety thresholds) with the following minimum information:\n\n- Decision description  \n- Rationale and consulted stakeholders  \n- Approver (role and name)  \n- Effective date and affected environments  \n\n**REQ-GOV-04 – Policy Alignment Documentation**  \nEVA SHALL maintain documentation demonstrating alignment between platform-level controls and applicable policies and guidance (e.g., TBS AI guidance, departmental policies, security and privacy standards). This documentation SHALL be updated as part of the platform change management process.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Traceability Requirements\n\n**REQ-TRC-01 – Interaction Provenance Capture**  \nFor each AI-assisted interaction, EVA SHALL capture a provenance record including at minimum:\n\n- User identifier and role  \n- Application / project space  \n- Date and time  \n- Environment (e.g., dev, test, prod)  \n- Model family and version used  \n- System prompt and key model parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p, safety flags)  \n- User prompt (or an appropriately redacted version, where required)  \n- Retrieved documents and data: IDs, versions, source system, and relevance scores  \n- Post-processing steps applied (e.g., re-ranking, redaction, translation, formatting)\n\n**REQ-TRC-02 – Tamper-Evident Logging**  \nEVA SHALL store provenance and audit logs in a manner that is tamper-evident (e.g., append-only, write-once mechanisms, or cryptographic techniques). Any attempted modification of historical logs SHALL be detectable.\n\n**REQ-TRC-03 – Reproducibility / Replay**  \nEVA SHALL provide a controlled “replay” capability that allows authorized roles (e.g., Ops, Privacy, Audit) to re-run a past interaction using the original configuration (model version, prompts, parameters, retrieved sources) to approximate the original output, where technically and legally feasible.\n\n**REQ-TRC-04 – Model and Configuration Lifecycle Traceability**  \nFor each deployed model or major configuration baseline, EVA SHALL record:\n\n- Deployment date and environment(s)  \n- Summary of training or fine-tuning data sources (at an abstract level) where applicable  \n- Evaluation results and known limitations  \n- Approval record (who approved, when, under what conditions)  \n\n**REQ-TRC-05 – Traceable Data Lineage**  \nFor each data source integrated into EVA (e.g., SharePoint libraries, jurisprudence database, AssistMe corpus), EVA SHALL maintain metadata describing:\n\n- Source system and owner  \n- Ingestion method and schedule  \n- Applicable security classification and retention requirements  \n- Data transformation and indexing steps  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Explainability & Transparency Requirements\n\n**REQ-XAI-01 – Source-Linked Answers (RAG)**  \nFor all RAG-based responses, EVA SHALL present users with the underlying sources used to generate the answer, including:\n\n- Document titles or identifiers  \n- Sections or excerpts (highlighted where possible)  \n- Links or navigation paths back to the original system, subject to access control  \n\n**REQ-XAI-02 – “Explain This Answer” Functionality**  \nEVA SHALL provide an optional “Explain this answer” feature that, when activated by the user, returns:\n\n- A concise explanation of which documents and sections were most influential  \n- Any key assumptions or constraints applied during reasoning  \n- A statement of limitations (e.g., incomplete coverage, date range of sources)  \n\n**REQ-XAI-03 – Knowledge Limits Indicators**  \nEVA SHALL clearly indicate knowledge limits in situations where:\n\n- No relevant documents were found  \n- Retrieved evidence is weak or conflicting  \n- The answer is extrapolated beyond available evidence  \n\nIndicators MAY include banners, badges, or warnings such as “Low confidence – verify against primary sources.”\n\n**REQ-XAI-04 – Assistant “About” Panel per Project**  \nEach EVA project space SHALL provide an “About this assistant” panel that describes in user-friendly terms:\n\n- The purpose of the assistant  \n- Data sources it can and cannot access  \n- The general type(s) of AI models used  \n- Known limitations and recommended usage patterns  \n- How users should verify outputs and report issues  \n\n**REQ-XAI-05 – Administrative Explainability View**  \nAdministrator and operations roles SHALL have access to enhanced explainability views for any interaction, including:\n\n- Full provenance details (subject to RBAC)  \n- Safety filters and policies triggered (if any)  \n- Metrics such as retrieval scores and token usage  \n\n---\n\n## 7. AI Services & Capabilities Beyond RAG\n\n**REQ-FUNC-01 – AI Service Catalog Exposure**  \nEVA SHALL expose its AI capabilities via well-defined APIs (e.g., through APIM). At minimum, the following service types SHALL be supported:\n\n- Retrieval & Question Answering (e.g., `/rag/retrieve`, `/rag/answer`)  \n- Document Summarization (e.g., `/doc/summarize`)  \n- Document Comparison and Alignment (e.g., `/doc/compare`)  \n- Information Extraction and Classification (e.g., `/doc/extract`)  \n- Assisted Drafting / Generation (e.g., `/gen/draft`)  \n\n**REQ-FUNC-02 – Support for Non-RAG Workflows**  \nEVA SHALL support non-RAG workflows (e.g., pure language model prompts, tool/agent-based interactions, structured data queries) with:\n\n- Explicit configuration flags differentiating RAG vs non-RAG behaviour  \n- Distinct guardrails and logging where required  \n- Clear indication to users when responses are not grounded in EVA-curated sources  \n\n**REQ-FUNC-03 – Synthetic Content Provenance**  \nEVA SHALL tag AI-generated content with provenance metadata that captures:\n\n- Originating assistant/app and project space  \n- User and time of generation  \n- Model family and version  \n\nWhere technically feasible and appropriate, EVA SHOULD support mechanisms to embed or attach digital content provenance signals to generated artefacts.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Monitoring, Quality & Safety Requirements\n\n**REQ-MON-01 – Trust & Performance Metrics**  \nEVA SHALL define and track key metrics related to trust and performance, such as:\n\n- Retrieval quality (e.g., proportion of answers with at least one relevant citation)  \n- Response latency and availability  \n- User feedback (e.g., “useful / not useful,” “accurate / inaccurate / biased / unsafe”)  \n- Frequency and type of safety or policy violations (e.g., attempts to bypass restrictions)  \n\nThese metrics SHALL be surfaced in a LiveOps dashboard for platform and project owners.\n\n**REQ-MON-02 – Alerting on Anomalies**  \nEVA SHALL implement automated alerts for anomalous patterns in usage or behaviour, including but not limited to:\n\n- Sudden spikes in traffic or token usage  \n- Unusual access patterns indicating potential misuse or compromise  \n- Significant increases in error rates or user-reported issues  \n\n**REQ-MON-03 – Red-Teaming & Regression Testing Suite**  \nEVA SHALL maintain a curated suite of adversarial tests and regression prompts addressing:\n\n- Prompt injection and jailbreak attempts  \n- Privacy leakage attempts (e.g., attempts to elicit personal or sensitive information)  \n- Bias and fairness probes in relevant contexts  \n- Known historical failure modes of the platform  \n\nThis suite SHALL be executed against new models or major configuration changes, and results SHALL be recorded and reviewed prior to production deployment.\n\n**REQ-MON-04 – Issue Reporting and Feedback Loop**  \nEVA SHALL provide users with a simple mechanism to report problematic outputs (e.g., inaccurate, biased, unsafe, or confusing responses). These reports SHALL feed into:\n\n- Incident management processes for high-severity issues  \n- Continuous model and prompt tuning for quality improvement  \n- Updates to training and awareness materials for users  \n\n---\n\n## 9. Security & Future Classification Readiness Requirements\n\n> **Note:** The current scope targets deployments up to Protected B. The following requirements are intended to ensure that EVA’s design does not preclude future deployments at higher classifications (e.g., Protected C, Secret), subject to separate decisions, funding, and accreditation.\n\n### 9.1 Architecture and Segregation\n\n**REQ-SEC-FUT-01 – Multi-Zone Deployability**  \nEVA SHALL be architected such that its core services (RAG, AI orchestration, configuration, logging, safety services) can be deployed into multiple security zones (e.g., Unclassified/Protected B, Protected C, Secret), with:\n\n- Distinct environments per zone  \n- Separation of networks, identities, and infrastructure resources  \n- No implicit dependencies between zones  \n\n**REQ-SEC-FUT-02 – No Default Cross-Domain Data Flow**  \nEVA’s default architecture SHALL prevent data from flowing from higher-classification zones (e.g., Protected C or Secret) to lower-classification zones. Any cross-domain data flow MUST:\n\n- Be explicitly designed and approved  \n- Use one-way, controlled, and audited mechanisms (e.g., cross-domain guards)  \n- Be covered by appropriate risk assessments and authorizations  \n\n**REQ-SEC-FUT-03 – Pluggable External Dependencies**  \nEVA SHALL avoid hard dependencies on services that cannot be accredited for higher security levels (e.g., public internet services, externally hosted telemetry). Where such dependencies exist in lower-classification deployments, EVA SHALL define patterns to:\n\n- Replace them with in-zone equivalents, or  \n- Disable those features gracefully in higher-classification deployments  \n\n### 9.2 Controls, Roles, and Accreditation\n\n**REQ-SEC-FUT-04 – Extensible Security Control Set**  \nEVA’s security control implementation (encryption, authentication, logging, backups, configuration management) SHALL be documented and structured to allow:\n\n- Mapping to stricter control baselines required for higher classifications  \n- Incremental hardening without major redesign of the platform  \n\n**REQ-SEC-FUT-05 – Role and Clearance Mapping**  \nEVA SHALL support mapping of application roles (e.g., end user, project admin, platform admin, ops/support) to Government of Canada personnel screening levels (e.g., Reliability, Secret, Top Secret). This SHALL enable higher classification deployments to enforce clearance requirements for access to EVA environments and data.\n\n**REQ-SEC-FUT-06 – Accreditation Package Readiness**  \nFor each environment, EVA SHALL maintain an up-to-date set of artefacts sufficient to support a formal security authorization / ATO process, including:\n\n- Architecture diagrams and data flow diagrams  \n- Security and privacy control mappings  \n- Risk assessments and mitigation plans  \n- Operational procedures (incident response, backup and restore, change management)  \n\n**REQ-SEC-FUT-07 – Configuration Baselines per Classification**  \nEVA SHALL define configuration baselines for each target classification level (e.g., cipher suites, logging verbosity and retention, backup handling, access restrictions). Uplifting from a lower to a higher classification SHOULD primarily involve:\n\n- Deployment into the appropriate zone, and  \n- Applying the stricter configuration baseline,  \n\nrather than redesigning or re-implementing core components.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Implementation & Traceability to Design and Operations\n\n- Each requirement in this document SHALL be traced to one or more design artefacts (architecture views, API specifications, data models, UI specifications) and operational procedures (runbooks, playbooks).\n- Changes to EVA that materially affect any requirement SHALL trigger an update to the requirement traceability matrix and, where appropriate, the requirement itself.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can next:\n\n- Turn this into a **requirements traceability matrix (RTM)** table (ID ↔ design component ↔ test approach), or  \n- Help you tailor a shorter “Executive/NIST-ish summary” version for governance decks while keeping this as the detailed annex."
