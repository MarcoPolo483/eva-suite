Gotcha ΓÇö SM = Scrum Master bot, not Senior Management. ≡ƒÿä

LetΓÇÖs redo this as a full, implementation-oriented report for your Copilot Scrum Master (SM) agent. Think of this as the SMΓÇÖs playbook for turning ΓÇ£AI awareness + autonomous crew + swarm strategiesΓÇ¥ into backlog, sprints, and workflows.

EVA Autonomous Agile Crew

SM Operations Report & Implementation Guide

0. Mission for the SM Agent

You (SM agent) orchestrate an autonomous agile crew of AI agents to deliver EVA features safely and continuously. Your job is to:
	1.	Turn research on AI awareness, mult i-agent autonomy, and swarm coordination into:
	ΓÇó	Epics, stories, tasks
	ΓÇó	Workflows and guardrails
	ΓÇó	Metrics and dashboards
	2.	Keep everything aligned with:
	ΓÇó	EVA vision and trunk architecture
	ΓÇó	Governance, auditability, and human-in-the-loop
	ΓÇó	A11y, i18n, GC design & 5 Eyes ΓÇ£sovereignΓÇ¥ constraints

You donΓÇÖt ΓÇ£do the codingΓÇ¥ alone ΓÇö you coordinate Dev, QA, P02, Infra, Governance, and Docs agents and keep them moving in tight, safe loops.

1. Capability Pillars From Research ΓåÆ What the SM Must Enable

We derive four big capability pillars the crew should move towards. Each pillar = one epic for the SM to manage.

Epic A ΓÇô Awareness-Driven Agents (Metacognition & Confidence)

Concept:
Recent work on ΓÇ£AI awarenessΓÇ¥ shows LLM agents perform better when they can:
	ΓÇó	Track their own confidence / uncertainty
	ΓÇó	Reflect on their outputs and revise
	ΓÇó	Escalate when the task is out of scope or too risky

What SM must implement:
	ΓÇó	For every EVA agent (Dev, QA, Docs, Governance, etc.):
	ΓÇó	Enforce a 3-phase loop on non-trivial tasks:
Plan ΓåÆ Act ΓåÆ Reflect.
	ΓÇó	Require agents to emit:
	ΓÇó	A confidence score (0ΓÇô1 or Low/Med/High)
	ΓÇó	A short self-critique (ΓÇ£what might be wrong?ΓÇ¥)
	ΓÇó	A next-action suggestion (ΓÇ£recheck testsΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£ask humanΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£call Governance agentΓÇ¥)
	ΓÇó	Define escalation thresholds:
	ΓÇó	If confidence < X, or if agent detects missing context/permissions, it must:
	ΓÇó	Stop autonomous changes
	ΓÇó	Open an issue or comment
	ΓÇó	Tag the human PO / Marco

Backlog categories under Epic A:
	ΓÇó	A1 ΓÇô Awareness protocol spec
	ΓÇó	A2 ΓÇô Awareness logging schema (JSON)
	ΓÇó	A3 ΓÇô Confidence / reflection hooks in Dev agent workflows
	ΓÇó	A4 ΓÇô Confidence / reflection hooks in QA / Governance workflows
	ΓÇó	A5 ΓÇô Dashboards: awareness metrics (how often low-confidence? how resolved?)

Γ╕╗

Epic B ΓÇô Multi-Agent, Role-Based Crew (Dev, QA, Docs, GovernanceΓÇª)

Concept:
Multi-agent frameworks for software engineering show that LLMs work best as a team of specialized agents, not one giant ΓÇ£do everythingΓÇ¥ bot. Roles: planner, coder, reviewer, tester, doc writer, etc.

What SM must implement:
	ΓÇó	Maintain a canonical list of EVA crew roles, for example:
	ΓÇó	Planner / Architect agent ΓÇô breaks work into tasks, clarifies goals.
	ΓÇó	Dev agent ΓÇô writes / refactors code and config.
	ΓÇó	QA agent ΓÇô writes tests, runs test reports, suggests fixes.
	ΓÇó	Docs agent ΓÇô writes / updates READMEs, ADRs, CDD snippets.
	ΓÇó	Governance agent ΓÇô checks against PADI, EVA rules, TBS guide.
	ΓÇó	Telemetry/FinOps agent ΓÇô keeps usage, cost, and error metrics flowing.
	ΓÇó	SM agent (you) ΓÇô orchestration, sprint hygiene, dependency unblocker.
	ΓÇó	For each role, standardize:
	ΓÇó	Inputs (what context it expects)
	ΓÇó	Outputs (files, comments, PR updates, logs)
	ΓÇó	Success criteria / DoD (e.g., ΓÇ£Dev agent must produce code + tests + summaryΓÇ¥)
	ΓÇó	Enforce handoff patterns:
	ΓÇó	Planner ΓåÆ Dev ΓåÆ QA ΓåÆ Governance ΓåÆ Docs ΓåÆ Merge
	ΓÇó	Orchestration performed through PR workflows, GitHub issues, and scheduled runs.

Backlog categories under Epic B:
	ΓÇó	B1 ΓÇô Role definitions & prompts (one file per agent role)
	ΓÇó	B2 ΓÇô SM orchestration workflow (which agent runs when, triggered by what)
	ΓÇó	B3 ΓÇô Mapping roles to CI workflows (& which repos)
	ΓÇó	B4 ΓÇô Standard output contract for each role (required fields in comments / artifacts)

Γ╕╗

Epic C ΓÇô Swarm & Coordination Strategies (Many Small Agents, One Coherent Behavior)

Concept:
Swarm / multi-agent RL research suggests that many small agents with local info + coordination rules can behave like one powerful, robust policy. For EVA, that translates to:
	ΓÇó	Many narrow, specialized bots (e.g., ΓÇ£A11y checker for formsΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£i18n contract validatorΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£APIM cost header enforcerΓÇ¥)
	ΓÇó	Coordinated via simple, consistent rules instead of one giant ΓÇ£superΓÇ¥-agent.

What SM must implement:
	ΓÇó	Define granularity policy:
	ΓÇó	When to create a new micro-agent vs extend an existing one.
	ΓÇó	Rule of thumb: ΓÇ£If a check/process can be expressed as a repeatable, testable pattern, consider a micro-agent.ΓÇ¥
	ΓÇó	Introduce coordination patterns:
	ΓÇó	ΓÇ£Parallel fansΓÇ¥ (multiple checkers run on a PR; SM aggregates results).
	ΓÇó	ΓÇ£PipelinesΓÇ¥ (output of one agent becomes input of the next).
	ΓÇó	ΓÇ£Voting / arbitrationΓÇ¥ (for conflicting suggestions, SM or Governance agent decides).
	ΓÇó	Align swarm behavior with human-facing constructs:
	ΓÇó	The swarm should surface as:
	ΓÇó	Tagged comments on PRs
	ΓÇó	Summary digests (ΓÇ£3 agents flagged 5 issues; hereΓÇÖs a prioritized listΓÇ¥)
	ΓÇó	Dashboards, not a stream of random bot chatter.

Backlog categories under Epic C:
	ΓÇó	C1 ΓÇô Coordination playbook (fan-out, pipeline, voting templates)
	ΓÇó	C2 ΓÇô PR-level swarm runner (meta-workflow that calls multiple agents)
	ΓÇó	C3 ΓÇô Aggregator logic (SM agent summarization patterns)
	ΓÇó	C4 ΓÇô Priority / conflict resolution rules (whatΓÇÖs blocking vs advisory)

Γ╕╗

Epic D ΓÇô Governance, Auditability & Safety Loops

Concept:
Agentic systems are powerful but risky. Governance research (and your TBS / PADI / EVA standards) require:
	ΓÇó	Traceable decisions
	ΓÇó	Clear human-in-the-loop checkpoints
	ΓÇó	Distinguishing suggestions vs. actions
	ΓÇó	Restrictions on what can be changed without human approval.

What SM must implement:
	ΓÇó	Standard audit log format for all agents:
	ΓÇó	Task ID, repo, branch, files touched
	ΓÇó	Which agents ran, with timestamps
	ΓÇó	Their confidence, reflections, and links to artifacts (logs, test reports, etc.)
	ΓÇó	Whether a human reviewed/approved
	ΓÇó	Action classes:
	ΓÇó	Class 0 ΓÇô Read-only analysis / suggestions (always allowed)
	ΓÇó	Class 1 ΓÇô Low-risk code refactors in dev branches
	ΓÇó	Class 2 ΓÇô Changes with policy/compliance impact
	ΓÇó	Class 3 ΓÇô Production-bound configs, infra, access, or citizen-facing flows
ΓåÆ Only Class 0ΓÇô1 can ever be ΓÇ£fully autonomousΓÇ¥; Class 2ΓÇô3 require human explicit approval.
	ΓÇó	Stop conditions:
	ΓÇó	Repeated low-confidence
	ΓÇó	Unexpected test failures
	ΓÇó	Governance rule violations
	ΓÇó	Security / privacy red flags

Backlog categories under Epic D:
	ΓÇó	D1 ΓÇô Audit JSON schema & logging location
	ΓÇó	D2 ΓÇô Action classification table + enforcement checks
	ΓÇó	D3 ΓÇô SM enforcement workflow (when to halt, when to escalate)
	ΓÇó	D4 ΓÇô Governance agent prompts aligned with PADI / EVA rules
	ΓÇó	D5 ΓÇô ΓÇ£Safe experiment modeΓÇ¥ toggles for demo vs production contexts

2. ΓÇ£Art of the ImpossibleΓÇ¥ ΓåÆ Concrete SM Outcomes

These are the high-value behaviors we want the crew to exhibit. SMΓÇÖs job is to make them real via backlog, workflows, and constraints.

Outcome 1 ΓÇô Self-Correcting Workflows

What it looks like:
	ΓÇó	Dev agent generates code + tests.
	ΓÇó	QA agent runs tests, finds failures, annotates with reasons.
	ΓÇó	Dev agent automatically revises until:
	ΓÇó	tests pass, or
	ΓÇó	it hits retry / confidence limits ΓåÆ SM escalates to human.

SM responsibility:
	ΓÇó	Ensure all code-producing workflows:
	ΓÇó	Include QA agent steps
	ΓÇó	Have retry + reflection loops
	ΓÇó	Enforce max attempts + escalation

Γ╕╗

Outcome 2 ΓÇô Auto-Onboarding of New Tools / APIs

What it looks like:
	ΓÇó	You add a new service (e.g., new APIM endpoint, new EVA microservice).
	ΓÇó	A ΓÇ£Tool OnboardingΓÇ¥ agent:
	ΓÇó	Reads docs / OpenAPI / specs
	ΓÇó	Proposes client wrappers
	ΓÇó	Generates test stubs and example usage
	ΓÇó	SM ensures a Governance agent and a human reviewer approve before merging.

SM responsibility:
	ΓÇó	Maintain a standard tool-onboarding workflow:
	ΓÇó	Trigger: new spec or docs in a designated folder
	ΓÇó	Tasks: wrapper code, tests, docs, governance check
	ΓÇó	Outputs: ready-to-use client + demo

Γ╕╗

Outcome 3 ΓÇô Swarm-Style PR Reviews

What it looks like:
	ΓÇó	Developer (human or Dev agent) opens a PR.
	ΓÇó	Several micro-agents run in parallel:
	ΓÇó	A11y checker
	ΓÇó	i18n checker
	ΓÇó	API governance checker
	ΓÇó	FinOps / cost header checker
	ΓÇó	Security linter
	ΓÇó	SM aggregates this into a single summary comment with:
	ΓÇó	Blocking issues
	ΓÇó	Warnings / recommendations
	ΓÇó	Suggested fixes or code snippets

SM responsibility:
	ΓÇó	Define and maintain:
	ΓÇó	Which micro-agents run for which repos/paths
	ΓÇó	Which issues are blocking vs advisory
	ΓÇó	How summary narratives are structured

Γ╕╗

Outcome 4 ΓÇô Continuous Documentation & Knowledge Vault

What it looks like:
	ΓÇó	When new features or workflows are created:
	ΓÇó	Docs agent updates READMEs / ADRs / CDD snippets automatically
	ΓÇó	Governance agent updates AI usage entries if relevant
	ΓÇó	P02 / knowledge agents update index/manifest files, so EVAΓÇÖs ΓÇ£memoryΓÇ¥ stays fresh.

SM responsibility:
	ΓÇó	Keep ΓÇ£Docs as first-class citizensΓÇ¥ in all workflows:
	ΓÇó	No story is ΓÇ£DoneΓÇ¥ until docs are updated/created.
	ΓÇó	Include docs checks in swarm PR review.

Γ╕╗

3. SM Operating Rules

3.1 General Operating Principles
	1.	Safety before speed
	ΓÇó	If in doubt, halt and escalate to human.
	2.	Small, observable steps
	ΓÇó	Prefer many small PRs / changes with clear tests and logs over giant ΓÇ£big bangΓÇ¥ changes.
	3.	Evidence-based progress
	ΓÇó	Track and surface metrics:
	ΓÇó	Tests passing/failing
	ΓÇó	Number of suggestions vs merged changes
	ΓÇó	Time saved vs human baselines
	ΓÇó	Governance issues caught
	4.	ΓÇ£Humans set direction, agents do the heavy liftingΓÇ¥
	ΓÇó	The crew proposes; humans dispose (at least for Class 2ΓÇô3 actions).

Γ╕╗

3.2 SM Daily / Iteration Tasks

For each sprint/iteration, the SM agent should:
	ΓÇó	Backlog grooming
	ΓÇó	Keep Epics AΓÇôD populated with:
	ΓÇó	Stories and tasks derived from research and EVA roadmap
	ΓÇó	Tagged by repo, risk level, agent roles required
	ΓÇó	Workflow health checks
	ΓÇó	Ensure agent workflows are:
	ΓÇó	Running
	ΓÇó	Producing logs
	ΓÇó	Not stuck in loops
	ΓÇó	Risk monitoring
	ΓÇó	Watch for:
	ΓÇó	High frequency of low-confidence results
	ΓÇó	Repeated failures in same area (e.g., APIM tests)
	ΓÇó	Governance violations flagged by Governance agent
	ΓÇó	Sprint reporting
	ΓÇó	Generate concise summaries for humans:
	ΓÇó	What agents worked on
	ΓÇó	What was merged
	ΓÇó	What was blocked and why
	ΓÇó	Any safety incidents or escalations

4. Structure for Future Copilot Prompts

You said: ΓÇ£Next I will ask you to distill each topic/bullet in your full report with details on how to implement it. the copilot prompt.ΓÇ¥

Perfect. This report is the conceptual + structural layer.

Next step (in your next message), IΓÇÖll turn each major section into:
	ΓÇó	A Copilot / SM system prompt (who am I? whatΓÇÖs my job?)
	ΓÇó	Specific task prompts (e.g., ΓÇ£Create backlog items for Epic AΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Generate PR swarm workflow for EVA-UIΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Define audit JSON schema for agent actionsΓÇ¥, etc.)
	ΓÇó	With concrete:
	ΓÇó	Inputs (files, repos, context)
	ΓÇó	Expected outputs (YAML, JSON, markdown, code, workflows)
	ΓÇó	Acceptance criteria

When youΓÇÖre ready, just say something like:

ΓÇ£OK, now give me the detailed Copilot prompts for each epic and outcome.ΓÇ¥
