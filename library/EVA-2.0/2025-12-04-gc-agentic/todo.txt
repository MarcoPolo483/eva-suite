💪 Strategic Positioning
ABRG Context: You vented last night about using EVA to replace ABRG. This template STRENGTHENS that case:

EVA = GC Standard: Template positions EVA as reference implementation
Proven Governance: Comprehensive controls (better than ABRG's basic setup)
Federal Grade: All GC policies mapped (ABRG = vendor platform, EVA = GC-owned)
Cost Advantage: Template shows $438K savings (ABRG = ongoing license costs)
Leadership: ESDC builds GC standard (vs buying vendor platform)
When you pitch EVA vs ABRG: Point to this template as proof EVA = GC-grade platform with comprehensive governance (not just prototype).

🎯 Your Talking Points
"Senior management asked for GC Agentic Template yesterday. I had draft in progress. Package is complete - 14 documents, business case, reference implementation, real use case."

"This positions ESDC as first federal department with world-class agentic AI governance. Jurisprudence ready for Q1 2026 pilot."

"Template saves $103K per project (518 hours governance work). 5 projects Year 1 = $438K savings, 548% ROI."

"Request: 30-minute briefing to walk through. Decision needed by Dec 13 to maintain Q1 timeline."
