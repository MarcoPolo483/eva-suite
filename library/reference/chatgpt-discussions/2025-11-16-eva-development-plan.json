      "content": "i started answering the questions with this... EVA IDE Tools (Siebel Tools-style IDE (Visual Builder))\nEVA Azure demo milestone\nYou can tell who I am and work for.\n\nWhat We Need:\nUser personas: Who uses Live Ops? \nCome with usual super system admin roles\nthen the same for customers tenants, and their customers\n\nUser journeys: What tasks? (Monitor, configure, troubleshoot)\nLike in the Enterprise Command Center. We need to see what the Command Center needs to see.. the same for their subordinated Command Centers. \nThe information to feed those dashboard should come from each infrastructure aspect that is not coved by Azure Dashboards already and make sense to EVA Command Center to have direct impact in the whole EVA Core Platform.\n\nThen the next level up, i believe would be for the best practices parameters that can be tuned in each components of the RAG box and exposed in the UI. I envision the possibility of creating entire pipelines using just the EVA RAG UI interface... that would be for Business Analysts building custom RAG solutions for projects to be deployed in EVA.\n\nThat's how we could fast onboard new clients. They test a sample EVA DA Accelerator RAG solution.. they load their files, run the ingestion and then can start asking questions to the EVA DA Accelerator interface. \n\nIn my mind, the prospect clients will want to know how much does cost to play in the Accelerator sandbox (you need to give some options on how to build and manage the sandboxes. today the AICOE has EVA DA 1.0 almost getting ATO to be in Protected B. To allow the single client initial architecture of the MS Information Assistant to be multi client, our team implemented RBAC and created 50 indexes for the 50 client spaces... There are more a hundred clients waiting, it is a mess... and monolithic.. the nice part is that they created Project roles for the client to manage their own content, the users. Project Admin, Contributor (content management) and reader.\n\nin EVA 2.0 I like the idea that EVA Project Space Administrators (PS-A) could deploy and manage the sandboxes and know how much is costing for each piece. The sandboxes are standard templates. Then once the client UAT of the Accelerator Sandbox space is finished, and sign the contract to become a production solution, then the EVA Project Space Administrator of that space would just turn a key and make it a production solution.\nAt this point the balance is resetted. From now on is Client Project Funding and CostCenter info provided.. Imagine that AICOE will want to have a powerbi dashboard to see the actuals of each box.. the sandboxes (as nothing is free forever), and the production ones as the actual costs really matters this time because we need to cost recover that. \n\nSo the PS-A would need to have a dashboard for the project, and be able to report it.. i like a powerbi dashboard. Now that the client is in production, the Business Analyst and the client can apply all customizations they need... and I mean all... examples the UI colors, wording, sample RAG questions, the system prompt, pipeline ingestion configuration of most types of data sources, the UI i18n and a11y... all as live as possible. back in my Siebel days, I would go to workflow Administration, create a new workflow, pick the elements i could need for a RAG solution (you remember the several types of RAG levels?), test it as much as needed and finally deploy it. \nAll done by terraform IaC, config files, web server reset, restarts. the PS-A owns the box.\n\nIn EVA, disregarding how long that would take the EVA PS-A to that configuration (which used to be a sandbox -- that is the default in case we need to refresh the config of production box), later the client would just refresh the browser and the EVA Production (not an Accelerator Sandbox anymore) Space and UI would be refreshed... if it crashes, no problem. no other client is impacted. there is complete isolations of the spaces -- the sandboxes and production live boxes.\nwe could have also powerbi dashboards for the sandboxes so the clients can see their costs live (not cost recovered, as for now, IITB is still funding client testing) \nAll of This just occurs after the clients signs and the PS-A is to told to turn the key to Production mode\n\nScreen flows: Dashboard → Drill-down → Action\n\n1)\nEVA PSA admin -- everything described above.\nBy the way, EVA PSA is just a role we can just grant in the EVA Directory... \nplus\nEVA PSA onws the box creation, cost recovery and termination. no leftovers in azure showing that the space existed. Of course the PSA should be able to export logs, configurations and so on.. the PSA can spin a space using those logs and configs.. then apply it and the whole EVA Project Space is created in Azure. EVA PSA can also delete the space.\nThe PSA also works with client in the maintenance of literals and the i18n and a11y requirements.\nthen can export and import it for easy maintenance.\nThose are literals\n\nWe need those screens, the role, seed data both languages, traceability.\n\n\n\n2)\nOops, I believe we would need EVA Directory\n-- we need to manage who is managing the spaces.\n-- we need to manage who is in the Consoles... for traceability.. we need versionsing.\n-- here EVA Directory has the keys for everything... remember the scene in the Matrix that Neo finds the Key Keeper.. \n\ni see we need someone like the Key Keeper.. no one knows about him. just the guy who built it all.. ;-)\n\nWe need those screens, the roles, seed data both languages, traceability.\n\n\n\n3)\nThe EVA Production Spaces is be managed by client's EVA Production Space Client Administrators.. \nThey can stop and start their solution so to avoid nightly costs or for any other reason. \nThe client manages the space. To change it, they need the EVA PS-BA and then the EVA PS-A.. all paid by project funding. Otherwise it is on them. \nWe need those screens, the roles, seed data both languages, traceability.\n\n\n4) EVA Command Center and its subordinates Command Centers\nthey own the responsibility and accountability for the whole solution. if it stops, all clients, projects, users stop...\nWe need those screens, the roles, seed data both languages, traceability.\n\n\n5) EVA Production Space Business Analysts - EVA PS-BA, another role\nthe Business Analyst and the client can apply all customizations they need... and I mean all... examples the UI colors, wording, sample RAG questions, the system prompt, pipeline ingestion configuration of most types of data sources, the UI i18n and a11y... all as live as possible. \n\nBack in my Siebel days, I would go to workflow Administration, create a new workflow, pick the elements i could need for a RAG solution (you remember the several types of RAG levels?), test it as much as needed and finally deploy it. \n\nAs they will work extensively with the clients doing all customizations possible, the client will also want to test the different versions of their solutions...\nso need versioning.\n\nthey will want to know how it costs.\n\nthey will need to test it... It is on the client the responsibility for the accuracy of the answers to the EVA Production Space services (that should be in the MOU).. so they need to test it. How? i know there are several tests we could apply.. it comes to my mind 100 questions and their gold answers are entered the EVA PS Test Bench where they would be able to sub test jobs (workflows) to simulate those 100 questions being answered a number of times, then comparing the answers given by the test bench with the golden questions. then the system could offer some metrics so the client can do their own due judgement accepting the solution or not. They can do as many configurations and tests as needed. it's on their pocket.\nAICOE offer the assistance of the PS-BA, PS-A, the Prompt Engineers PS-PE. the whole team is at their disposition to build Agents that would augment the basic (or not so much) RAG capabilities. Built in MCP and Agentic capabilities allows EVA PS-BA to create workflows or possibly even autonomous agents.\n\n\n/\nthe configuration  some assurance and alertings \n\nWe need those screens, the roles, seed data both languages, traceability.\n\n\n\nWireframes: Low-fi sketches before high-fi design... .... develop my line of thought and provide the answer"
