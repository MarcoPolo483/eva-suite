Here is your **clean final Markdown status block** exactly matching the pattern of your dev team’s update — short, factual, no fluff, ready to paste into GitHub, Teams, or an email.

* Sprint 03 priority = **Real APIM wiring + persisted threads**.
* Sprint 04 priority = **SharePoint publication, CDD alignment, expanded test suite, a11y regression**.

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ a **Copilot prompt** that will perform these same project-board updates automatically for future sprints
✅ a **Sprint 03 plan** (tasks, estimates, risks)
✅ a **Release Note for EVA Chat Frame 0.1.0** (polished, shareable with the team)

Just say the word.
